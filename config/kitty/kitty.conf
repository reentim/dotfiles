cursor none

#: Default text cursor color. If set to the special value none the
#: cursor will be rendered with a "reverse video" effect. Its color
#: will be the color of the text in the cell it is over and the text
#: will be rendered with the background color of the cell. Note that
#: if the program running in the terminal sets a cursor color, this
#: takes precedence. Also, the cursor colors are modified if the cell
#: background and foreground colors have very low contrast. Note that
#: some themes set this value, so if you want to override it, place
#: your value after the lines where the theme file is included.

# cursor_text_color background

#: The color of text under the cursor. If you want it rendered with
#: the background color of the cell underneath instead, use the
#: special keyword: `background`. Note that if cursor is set to none
#: then this option is ignored. Note that some themes set this value,
#: so if you want to override it, place your value after the lines
#: where the theme file is included.

cursor_shape block

# cursor_shape_unfocused hollow

#: Defines the text cursor shape when the OS window is not focused.
#: The unfocused cursor shape can be one of block, beam, underline,
#: hollow and unchanged (leave the cursor shape as it is).

# cursor_blink_interval -1

#: The interval to blink the cursor (in seconds). Set to zero to
#: disable blinking. Negative values mean use system default. Note
#: that the minimum interval will be limited to repaint_delay. You can
#: also animate the cursor blink by specifying an easing function. For
#: example, setting this to option to 0.5 ease-in-out will cause the
#: cursor blink to be animated over a second, in the first half of the
#: second it will go from opaque to transparent and then back again
#: over the next half. You can specify different easing functions for
#: the two halves, for example: -1 linear ease-out. kitty supports all
#: the CSS easing functions <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-
#: US/docs/Web/CSS/easing-function>. Note that turning on animations
#: uses extra power as it means the screen is redrawn multiple times
#: per blink interval. See also, cursor_stop_blinking_after.

# cursor_stop_blinking_after 15.0

#: Stop blinking cursor after the specified number of seconds of
#: keyboard inactivity. Set to zero to never stop blinking.

strip_trailing_spaces always

#: Remove spaces at the end of lines when copying to clipboard. A
#: value of smart will do it when using normal selections, but not
#: rectangle selections. A value of always will always do it.

# select_by_word_characters @-./_~?&=%+#

#: Characters considered part of a word when double clicking. In
#: addition to these characters any character that is marked as an
#: alphanumeric character in the Unicode database will be matched.

# select_by_word_characters_forward

#: Characters considered part of a word when extending the selection
#: forward on double clicking. In addition to these characters any
#: character that is marked as an alphanumeric character in the
#: Unicode database will be matched.

#: If empty (default) select_by_word_characters will be used for both
#: directions.

# click_interval -1.0

#: The interval between successive clicks to detect double/triple
#: clicks (in seconds). Negative numbers will use the system default
#: instead, if available, or fallback to 0.5.

# focus_follows_mouse no

#: Set the active window to the window under the mouse when moving the
#: mouse around. On macOS, this will also cause the OS Window under
#: the mouse to be focused automatically when the mouse enters it.

#: Performance tuning {{{

# repaint_delay 10

#: Delay between screen updates (in milliseconds). Decreasing it,
#: increases frames-per-second (FPS) at the cost of more CPU usage.
#: The default value yields ~100 FPS which is more than sufficient for
#: most uses. Note that to actually achieve 100 FPS, you have to
#: either set sync_to_monitor to no or use a monitor with a high
#: refresh rate. Also, to minimize latency when there is pending input
#: to be processed, this option is ignored.

# input_delay 3

#: Delay before input from the program running in the terminal is
#: processed (in milliseconds). Note that decreasing it will increase
#: responsiveness, but also increase CPU usage and might cause flicker
#: in full screen programs that redraw the entire screen on each loop,
#: because kitty is so fast that partial screen updates will be drawn.
#: This setting is ignored when the input buffer is almost full.

# sync_to_monitor yes

#: Sync screen updates to the refresh rate of the monitor. This
#: prevents screen tearing
#: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_tearing> when scrolling.
#: However, it limits the rendering speed to the refresh rate of your
#: monitor. With a very high speed mouse/high keyboard repeat rate,
#: you may notice some slight input latency. If so, set this to no.

#: }}}

#: Terminal bell {{{

enable_audio_bell no

window_padding_width 4

#: The window padding (in pts) (blank area between the text and the
#: window border). A single value sets all four sides. Two values set
#: the vertical and horizontal sides. Three values set top, horizontal
#: and bottom. Four values set top, right, bottom and left.

# hide_window_decorations no

#: Hide the window decorations (title-bar and window borders) with
#: yes. On macOS, titlebar-only and titlebar-and-corners can be used
#: to only hide the titlebar and the rounded corners. Whether this
#: works and exactly what effect it has depends on the window
#: manager/operating system. Note that the effects of changing this
#: option when reloading config are undefined. When using titlebar-
#: only, it is useful to also set window_margin_width and
#: placement_strategy to prevent the rounded corners from clipping
#: text. Or use titlebar-and-corners.

#: Color scheme {{{

# foreground #dddddd
# background #000000

#: The foreground and background colors.

background_opacity 1.0

#: The opacity of the background. A number between zero and one, where
#: one is opaque and zero is fully transparent. This will only work if
#: supported by the OS (for instance, when using a compositor under
#: X11). Note that it only sets the background color's opacity in
#: cells that have the same background color as the default terminal
#: background, so that things like the status bar in vim, powerline
#: prompts, etc. still look good. But it means that if you use a color
#: theme with a background color in your editor, it will not be
#: rendered as transparent. Instead you should change the default
#: background color in your kitty config and not use a background
#: color in the editor color scheme. Or use the escape codes to set
#: the terminals default colors in a shell script to launch your
#: editor. See also transparent_background_colors. Be aware that using
#: a value less than 1.0 is a (possibly significant) performance hit.
#: When using a low value for this setting, it is desirable that you
#: set the background color to a color the matches the general color
#: of the desktop background, for best text rendering.  If you want to
#: dynamically change transparency of windows, set
#: dynamic_background_opacity to yes (this is off by default as it has
#: a performance cost). Changing this option when reloading the config
#: will only work if dynamic_background_opacity was enabled in the
#: original config.

# background_blur 0

#: Set to a positive value to enable background blur (blurring of the
#: visuals behind a transparent window) on platforms that support it.
#: Only takes effect when background_opacity is less than one. On
#: macOS, this will also control the blur radius (amount of blurring).
#: Setting it to too high a value will cause severe performance issues
#: and/or rendering artifacts. Usually, values up to 64 work well.
#: Note that this might cause performance issues, depending on how the
#: platform implements it, so use with care. Currently supported on
#: macOS and KDE.

# background_image none

#: Path to a background image. Must be in PNG/JPEG/WEBP/TIFF/GIF/BMP
#: format.

# background_image_layout tiled

#: Whether to tile, scale or clamp the background image. The value can
#: be one of tiled, mirror-tiled, scaled, clamped, centered or
#: cscaled. The scaled and cscaled values scale the image to the
#: window size, with cscaled preserving the image aspect ratio.

# background_image_linear no

#: When background image is scaled, whether linear interpolation
#: should be used.

# transparent_background_colors

#: A space separated list of upto 7 colors, with opacity. When the
#: background color of a cell matches one of these colors, it is
#: rendered semi-transparent using the specified opacity.

#: Useful in more complex UIs like editors where you could want more
#: than a single background color to be rendered as transparent, for
#: instance, for a cursor highlight line background or a highlighted
#: block. Terminal applications can set this color using The kitty
#: color control <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/color-stack/#color-
#: control> escape code.

#: The syntax for specifiying colors is: color@opacity, where the
#: @opacity part is optional. When unspecified, the value of
#: background_opacity is used. For example::

#:     transparent_background_colors red@0.5 #00ff00@0.3

# dynamic_background_opacity no

#: Allow changing of the background_opacity dynamically, using either
#: keyboard shortcuts (increase_background_opacity and
#: decrease_background_opacity) or the remote control facility.
#: Changing this option by reloading the config is not supported.

# background_tint 0.0

#: How much to tint the background image by the background color. This
#: option makes it easier to read the text. Tinting is done using the
#: current background color for each window. This option applies only
#: if background_opacity is set and transparent windows are supported
#: or background_image is set.

# background_tint_gaps 1.0

#: How much to tint the background image at the window gaps by the
#: background color, after applying background_tint. Since this is
#: multiplicative with background_tint, it can be used to lighten the
#: tint over the window gaps for a *separated* look.

# dim_opacity 0.4

#: How much to dim text that has the DIM/FAINT attribute set. One
#: means no dimming and zero means fully dimmed (i.e. invisible).

# selection_foreground #000000
# selection_background #fffacd

#: The foreground and background colors for text selected with the
#: mouse. Setting both of these to none will cause a "reverse video"
#: effect for selections, where the selection will be the cell text
#: color and the text will become the cell background color. Setting
#: only selection_foreground to none will cause the foreground color
#: to be used unchanged. Note that these colors can be overridden by
#: the program running in the terminal.

shell env TERM_PROGRAM=Kitty "$HOME/bin/tmux-attach-or-new"

#: The shell program to execute. The default value of . means to use
#: the value of of the SHELL environment variable or if unset,
#: whatever shell is set as the default shell for the current user.
#: Note that on macOS if you change this, you might need to add
#: --login and --interactive to ensure that the shell starts in
#: interactive mode and reads its startup rc files. Environment
#: variables are expanded in this setting.

# editor .

#: The terminal based text editor (such as vim or nano) to use when
#: editing the kitty config file or similar tasks.

#: The default value of . means to use the environment variables
#: VISUAL and EDITOR in that order. If these variables aren't set,
#: kitty will run your shell ($SHELL -l -i -c env) to see if your
#: shell startup rc files set VISUAL or EDITOR. If that doesn't work,
#: kitty will cycle through various known editors (vim, emacs, etc.)
#: and take the first one that exists on your system.

# close_on_child_death no

#: Close the window when the child process (usually the shell) exits.
#: With the default value no, the terminal will remain open when the
#: child exits as long as there are still other processes outputting
#: to the terminal (for example disowned or backgrounded processes).
#: When enabled with yes, the window will close as soon as the child
#: process exits. Note that setting it to yes means that any
#: background processes still using the terminal can fail silently
#: because their stdout/stderr/stdin no longer work.

# env

#: Specify the environment variables to be set in all child processes.
#: Using the name with an equal sign (e.g. env VAR=) will set it to
#: the empty string. Specifying only the name (e.g. env VAR) will
#: remove the variable from the child process' environment. Note that
#: environment variables are expanded recursively, for example::

#:     env VAR1=a
#:     env VAR2=${HOME}/${VAR1}/b

#: The value of VAR2 will be <path to home directory>/a/b.

# clipboard_control write-clipboard write-primary read-clipboard-ask read-primary-ask

#: Allow programs running in kitty to read and write from the
#: clipboard. You can control exactly which actions are allowed. The
#: possible actions are: write-clipboard, read-clipboard, write-
#: primary, read-primary, read-clipboard-ask, read-primary-ask. The
#: default is to allow writing to the clipboard and primary selection
#: and to ask for permission when a program tries to read from the
#: clipboard. Note that disabling the read confirmation is a security
#: risk as it means that any program, even the ones running on a
#: remote server via SSH can read your clipboard. See also
#: clipboard_max_size.

# clipboard_max_size 512

#: The maximum size (in MB) of data from programs running in kitty
#: that will be stored for writing to the system clipboard. A value of
#: zero means no size limit is applied. See also clipboard_control.

shell_integration no-cursor

#: Enable shell integration on supported shells. This enables features
#: such as jumping to previous prompts, browsing the output of the
#: previous command in a pager, etc. on supported shells. Set to
#: disabled to turn off shell integration, completely. It is also
#: possible to disable individual features, set to a space separated
#: list of these values: no-rc, no-cursor, no-title, no-cwd, no-
#: prompt-mark, no-complete, no-sudo. See Shell integration
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/shell-integration/> for details.

# notify_on_cmd_finish never

#: Show a desktop notification when a long-running command finishes
#: (needs shell_integration). The possible values are:

#: never
#:     Never send a notification.

#: unfocused
#:     Only send a notification when the window does not have keyboard focus.

#: invisible
#:     Only send a notification when the window both is unfocused and not visible
#:     to the user, for example, because it is in an inactive tab or its OS window
#:     is not currently active.

#: always
#:     Always send a notification, regardless of window state.

#: There are two optional arguments:

#: First, the minimum duration for what is considered a long running
#: command. The default is 5 seconds. Specify a second argument to set
#: the duration. For example: invisible 15. Do not set the value too
#: small, otherwise a command that launches a new OS Window and exits
#: will spam a notification.

#: Second, the action to perform. The default is notify. The possible
#: values are:

#: notify
#:     Send a desktop notification.

#: bell
#:     Ring the terminal bell.

#: command
#:     Run a custom command. All subsequent arguments are the cmdline to run.

#: Some more examples::

#:     # Send a notification when a command takes more than 5 seconds in an unfocused window
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish unfocused
#:     # Send a notification when a command takes more than 10 seconds in a invisible window
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 10.0
#:     # Ring a bell when a command takes more than 10 seconds in a invisible window
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 10.0 bell
#:     # Run 'notify-send' when a command takes more than 10 seconds in a invisible window
#:     # Here %c is replaced by the current command line and %s by the job exit code
#:     notify_on_cmd_finish invisible 10.0 command notify-send "job finished with status: %s" %c

# term xterm-kitty

#: The value of the TERM environment variable to set. Changing this
#: can break many terminal programs, only change it if you know what
#: you are doing, not because you read some advice on "Stack Overflow"
#: to change it. The TERM variable is used by various programs to get
#: information about the capabilities and behavior of the terminal. If
#: you change it, depending on what programs you run, and how
#: different the terminal you are changing it to is, various things
#: from key-presses, to colors, to various advanced features may not
#: work. Changing this option by reloading the config will only affect
#: newly created windows.

# terminfo_type path

#: The value of the TERMINFO environment variable to set. This
#: variable is used by programs running in the terminal to search for
#: terminfo databases. The default value of path causes kitty to set
#: it to a filesystem location containing the kitty terminfo database.
#: A value of direct means put the entire database into the env var
#: directly. This can be useful when connecting to containers, for
#: example. But, note that not all software supports this. A value of
#: none means do not touch the variable.

# forward_stdio no

#: Forward STDOUT and STDERR of the kitty process to child processes
#: as file descriptors 3 and 4. This is useful for debugging as it
#: allows child processes to print to kitty's STDOUT directly. For
#: example, echo hello world >&3 in a shell will print to the parent
#: kitty's STDOUT. When enabled, this also sets the
#: KITTY_STDIO_FORWARDED=3 environment variable so child processes
#: know about the forwarding.

# menu_map

#: Specify entries for various menus in kitty. Currently only the
#: global menubar on macOS is supported. For example::

#:    menu_map global "Actions::Launch something special" launch --hold --type=os-window sh -c "echo hello world"

#: This will create a menu entry named "Launch something special" in
#: an "Actions" menu in the macOS global menubar. Sub-menus can be
#: created by adding more levels separated by the :: characters.

#: }}}

#: OS specific tweaks {{{

# wayland_titlebar_color system

#: The color of the kitty window's titlebar on Wayland systems with
#: client side window decorations such as GNOME. A value of system
#: means to use the default system colors, a value of background means
#: to use the background color of the currently active kitty window
#: and finally you can use an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or red.

# macos_titlebar_color system

#: The color of the kitty window's titlebar on macOS. A value of
#: system means to use the default system color, light or dark can
#: also be used to set it explicitly. A value of background means to
#: use the background color of the currently active window and finally
#: you can use an arbitrary color, such as #12af59 or red. WARNING:
#: This option works by using a hack when arbitrary color (or
#: background) is configured, as there is no proper Cocoa API for it.
#: It sets the background color of the entire window and makes the
#: titlebar transparent. As such it is incompatible with
#: background_opacity. If you want to use both, you are probably
#: better off just hiding the titlebar with hide_window_decorations.

macos_option_as_alt yes

#: Use the Option key as an Alt key on macOS. With this set to no,
#: kitty will use the macOS native Option+Key to enter Unicode
#: character behavior. This will break any Alt+Key keyboard shortcuts
#: in your terminal programs, but you can use the macOS Unicode input
#: technique. You can use the values: left, right or both to use only
#: the left, right or both Option keys as Alt, instead. Note that
#: kitty itself always treats Option the same as Alt. This means you
#: cannot use this option to configure different kitty shortcuts for
#: Option+Key vs. Alt+Key. Also, any kitty shortcuts using
#: Option/Alt+Key will take priority, so that any such key presses
#: will not be passed to terminal programs running inside kitty.
#: Changing this option by reloading the config is not supported.

# macos_hide_from_tasks no

#: Hide the kitty window from running tasks on macOS (⌘+Tab and the
#: Dock). Changing this option by reloading the config is not
#: supported.

# macos_quit_when_last_window_closed no

#: Have kitty quit when all the top-level windows are closed on macOS.
#: By default, kitty will stay running, even with no open windows, as
#: is the expected behavior on macOS.

# macos_window_resizable yes

#: Disable this if you want kitty top-level OS windows to not be
#: resizable on macOS.

# macos_thicken_font 0

#: Draw an extra border around the font with the given width, to
#: increase legibility at small font sizes on macOS. For example, a
#: value of 0.75 will result in rendering that looks similar to sub-
#: pixel antialiasing at common font sizes. Note that in modern kitty,
#: this option is obsolete (although still supported). Consider using
#: text_composition_strategy instead.

macos_traditional_fullscreen yes


#: Use the macOS traditional full-screen transition, that is faster,
#: but less pretty.

# macos_show_window_title_in all

#: Control where the window title is displayed on macOS. A value of
#: window will show the title of the currently active window at the
#: top of the macOS window. A value of menubar will show the title of
#: the currently active window in the macOS global menu bar, making
#: use of otherwise wasted space. A value of all will show the title
#: in both places, and none hides the title. See
#: macos_menubar_title_max_length for how to control the length of the
#: title in the menu bar.

# macos_menubar_title_max_length 0

#: The maximum number of characters from the window title to show in
#: the macOS global menu bar. Values less than one means that there is
#: no maximum limit.

# macos_custom_beam_cursor no

#: Use a custom mouse cursor for macOS that is easier to see on both
#: light and dark backgrounds. Nowadays, the default macOS cursor
#: already comes with a white border. WARNING: this might make your
#: mouse cursor invisible on dual GPU machines. Changing this option
#: by reloading the config is not supported.

# macos_colorspace srgb

#: The colorspace in which to interpret terminal colors. The default
#: of srgb will cause colors to match those seen in web browsers. The
#: value of default will use whatever the native colorspace of the
#: display is. The value of displayp3 will use Apple's special
#: snowflake display P3 color space, which will result in over
#: saturated (brighter) colors with some color shift. Reloading
#: configuration will change this value only for newly created OS
#: windows.

# linux_display_server auto

#: Choose between Wayland and X11 backends. By default, an appropriate
#: backend based on the system state is chosen automatically. Set it
#: to x11 or wayland to force the choice. Changing this option by
#: reloading the config is not supported.

# wayland_enable_ime yes

#: Enable Input Method Extension on Wayland. This is typically used
#: for inputting text in East Asian languages. However, its
#: implementation in Wayland is often buggy and introduces latency
#: into the input loop, so disable this if you know you dont need it.
#: Changing this option by reloading the config is not supported, it
#: will not have any effect.

#: }}}

#: Keyboard shortcuts {{{

#: Keys are identified simply by their lowercase Unicode characters.
#: For example: a for the A key, [ for the left square bracket key,
#: etc. For functional keys, such as Enter or Escape, the names are
#: present at Functional key definitions
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/keyboard-protocol/#functional>.
#: For modifier keys, the names are ctrl (control, ⌃), shift (⇧), alt
#: (opt, option, ⌥), super (cmd, command, ⌘).

#: Simple shortcut mapping is done with the map directive. For full
#: details on advanced mapping including modal and per application
#: maps, see mapping <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/mapping/>. Some
#: quick examples to illustrate common tasks::

#:     # unmap a keyboard shortcut, passing it to the program running in kitty
#:     map kitty_mod+space
#:     # completely ignore a keyboard event
#:     map ctrl+alt+f1 discard_event
#:     # combine multiple actions
#:     map kitty_mod+e combine : new_window : next_layout
#:     # multi-key shortcuts
#:     map ctrl+x>ctrl+y>z action

#: The full list of actions that can be mapped to key presses is
#: available here <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/actions/>.

# kitty_mod ctrl+shift

#: Special modifier key alias for default shortcuts. You can change
#: the value of this option to alter all default shortcuts that use
#: kitty_mod.

# clear_all_shortcuts no

#: Remove all shortcut definitions up to this point. Useful, for
#: instance, to remove the default shortcuts.

# action_alias

#: E.g. action_alias launch_tab launch --type=tab --cwd=current

#: Define action aliases to avoid repeating the same options in
#: multiple mappings. Aliases can be defined for any action and will
#: be expanded recursively. For example, the above alias allows you to
#: create mappings to launch a new tab in the current working
#: directory without duplication::

#:     map f1 launch_tab vim
#:     map f2 launch_tab emacs

#: Similarly, to alias kitten invocation::

#:     action_alias hints kitten hints --hints-offset=0

# kitten_alias

#: E.g. kitten_alias hints hints --hints-offset=0

#: Like action_alias above, but specifically for kittens. Generally,
#: prefer to use action_alias. This option is a legacy version,
#: present for backwards compatibility. It causes all invocations of
#: the aliased kitten to be substituted. So the example above will
#: cause all invocations of the hints kitten to have the --hints-
#: offset=0 option applied.

#: Clipboard {{{

#: Copy to clipboard

# map kitty_mod+c copy_to_clipboard
# map cmd+c       copy_to_clipboard

#::  There is also a copy_or_interrupt action that can be optionally
#::  mapped to Ctrl+C. It will copy only if there is a selection and
#::  send an interrupt otherwise. Similarly,
#::  copy_and_clear_or_interrupt will copy and clear the selection or
#::  send an interrupt if there is no selection.

#: Paste from clipboard

# map kitty_mod+v paste_from_clipboard
# map cmd+v       paste_from_clipboard

#: Paste from selection

# map kitty_mod+s  paste_from_selection
# map shift+insert paste_from_selection

#: Pass selection to program

# map kitty_mod+o pass_selection_to_program

#::  You can also pass the contents of the current selection to any
#::  program with pass_selection_to_program. By default, the system's
#::  open program is used, but you can specify your own, the selection
#::  will be passed as a command line argument to the program. For

#: New window

# map kitty_mod+enter new_window
# map cmd+enter       new_window

#::  You can open a new kitty window running an arbitrary program, for
#::  example::

#::      map kitty_mod+y launch mutt

#::  You can open a new window with the current working directory set
#::  to the working directory of the current window using::

#::      map ctrl+alt+enter launch --cwd=current

#::  You can open a new window that is allowed to control kitty via
#::  the kitty remote control facility with launch --allow-remote-
#::  control. Any programs running in that window will be allowed to
#::  control kitty. For example::

#::      map ctrl+enter launch --allow-remote-control some_program

#::  You can open a new window next to the currently active window or
#::  as the first window, with::

#::      map ctrl+n launch --location=neighbor
#::      map ctrl+f launch --location=first

#::  For more details, see launch
#::  <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/launch/>.

#: New OS window

# map kitty_mod+n new_os_window
# map cmd+n       new_os_window

#::  Works like new_window above, except that it opens a top-level OS
#::  window. In particular you can use new_os_window_with_cwd to open
#::  a window with the current working directory.

#: Close window

# map kitty_mod+w close_window
# map shift+cmd+d close_window

#: Next window

# map kitty_mod+] next_window

#: Previous window

# map kitty_mod+[ previous_window

#: Move window forward

# map kitty_mod+f move_window_forward

#: Move window backward

# map kitty_mod+b move_window_backward

#: Move window to top

# map kitty_mod+` move_window_to_top

#: Start resizing window

# map kitty_mod+r start_resizing_window
# map cmd+r       start_resizing_window

#: First window

# map kitty_mod+1 first_window
# map cmd+1       first_window

#: Second window

# map kitty_mod+2 second_window
# map cmd+2       second_window

#: Third window

# map kitty_mod+3 third_window
# map cmd+3       third_window

#: Fourth window

# map kitty_mod+4 fourth_window
# map cmd+4       fourth_window

#: Fifth window

# map kitty_mod+5 fifth_window
# map cmd+5       fifth_window

#: Sixth window

# map kitty_mod+6 sixth_window
# map cmd+6       sixth_window

#: Seventh window

# map kitty_mod+7 seventh_window
# map cmd+7       seventh_window

#: Eighth window

# map kitty_mod+8 eighth_window
# map cmd+8       eighth_window

#: Ninth window

# map kitty_mod+9 ninth_window
# map cmd+9       ninth_window

#: Tenth window

# map kitty_mod+0 tenth_window

#: Visually select and focus window

# map kitty_mod+f7 focus_visible_window

#::  Display overlay numbers and alphabets on the window, and switch
#::  the focus to the window when you press the key. When there are
#::  only two windows, the focus will be switched directly without
#::  displaying the overlay. You can change the overlay characters and
#::  their order with option visual_window_select_characters.

#: Visually swap window with another

# map kitty_mod+f8 swap_with_window

#::  Works like focus_visible_window above, but swaps the window.

#: }}}

#: Tab management {{{

#: Next tab

# map kitty_mod+right next_tab
# map shift+cmd+]     next_tab
# map ctrl+tab        next_tab

#: Previous tab

# map kitty_mod+left previous_tab
# map shift+cmd+[    previous_tab
# map ctrl+shift+tab previous_tab

#: New tab

# map kitty_mod+t new_tab
# map cmd+t       new_tab

#: Close tab

# map kitty_mod+q close_tab
# map cmd+w       close_tab

#: Close OS window

# map shift+cmd+w close_os_window

#: Move tab forward

# map kitty_mod+. move_tab_forward

#: Move tab backward

# map kitty_mod+, move_tab_backward

#: Set tab title

# map kitty_mod+alt+t set_tab_title
# map shift+cmd+i     set_tab_title


#: You can also create shortcuts to go to specific tabs, with 1 being
#: the first tab, 2 the second tab and -1 being the previously active
#: tab, -2 being the tab active before the previously active tab and
#: so on. Any number larger than the number of tabs goes to the last
#: tab and any number less than the number of previously used tabs in
#: the history goes to the oldest previously used tab in the history::

#:     map ctrl+alt+1 goto_tab 1
#:     map ctrl+alt+2 goto_tab 2

#: Just as with new_window above, you can also pass the name of
#: arbitrary commands to run when using new_tab and new_tab_with_cwd.
#: Finally, if you want the new tab to open next to the current tab
#: rather than at the end of the tabs list, use::

#:     map ctrl+t new_tab !neighbor [optional cmd to run]
#: }}}

#: Layout management {{{

#: Next layout

# map kitty_mod+l next_layout


#: You can also create shortcuts to switch to specific layouts::

#:     map ctrl+alt+t goto_layout tall
#:     map ctrl+alt+s goto_layout stack

#: Similarly, to switch back to the previous layout::

#:     map ctrl+alt+p last_used_layout

#: There is also a toggle_layout action that switches to the named
#: layout or back to the previous layout if in the named layout.
#: Useful to temporarily "zoom" the active window by switching to the
#: stack layout::

#:     map ctrl+alt+z toggle_layout stack
#: }}}

#: Font sizes {{{

#: You can change the font size for all top-level kitty OS windows at
#: a time or only the current one.

#: Increase font size

# map kitty_mod+equal  change_font_size all +2.0
# map kitty_mod+plus   change_font_size all +2.0
# map kitty_mod+kp_add change_font_size all +2.0
# map cmd+plus         change_font_size all +2.0
# map cmd+equal        change_font_size all +2.0
map ctrl+equal  change_font_size all +0.5

#: Decrease font size

# map kitty_mod+minus       change_font_size all -2.0
# map kitty_mod+kp_subtract change_font_size all -2.0
# map cmd+minus             change_font_size all -2.0
map ctrl+minus       change_font_size all -0.5

#: Reset font size

# map kitty_mod+backspace change_font_size all 0
map ctrl+0               change_font_size all 0


#: To setup shortcuts for specific font sizes::

#:     map kitty_mod+f6 change_font_size all 10.0

#: To setup shortcuts to change only the current OS window's font
#: size::

#:     map kitty_mod+f6 change_font_size current 10.0

#: Select and act on visible text {{{

#: Use the hints kitten to select text and either pass it to an
#: external program or insert it into the terminal or copy it to the
#: clipboard.

#: Open URL

# map kitty_mod+e open_url_with_hints

#::  Open a currently visible URL using the keyboard. The program used
#::  to open the URL is specified in open_url_with.

#: Insert selected path

# map kitty_mod+p>f kitten hints --type path --program -

#::  Select a path/filename and insert it into the terminal. Useful,
#::  for instance to run git commands on a filename output from a
#::  previous git command.

#: Open selected path

# map kitty_mod+p>shift+f kitten hints --type path

#::  Select a path/filename and open it with the default open program.

#: Insert selected line

# map kitty_mod+p>l kitten hints --type line --program -

#::  Select a line of text and insert it into the terminal. Useful for
#::  the output of things like: `ls -1`.

#: Insert selected word

# map kitty_mod+p>w kitten hints --type word --program -

#::  Select words and insert into terminal.

#: Insert selected hash

# map kitty_mod+p>h kitten hints --type hash --program -

#::  Select something that looks like a hash and insert it into the
#::  terminal. Useful with git, which uses SHA1 hashes to identify
#::  commits.

#: Open the selected file at the selected line

# map kitty_mod+p>n kitten hints --type linenum

#::  Select something that looks like filename:linenum and open it in
#::  your default editor at the specified line number.

#: Open the selected hyperlink

# map kitty_mod+p>y kitten hints --type hyperlink

#::  Select a hyperlink (i.e. a URL that has been marked as such by
#::  the terminal program, for example, by `ls --hyperlink=auto`).


#: The hints kitten has many more modes of operation that you can map
#: to different shortcuts. For a full description see hints kitten
#: <https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/hints/>.

#: Reset background opacity

# map kitty_mod+a>d set_background_opacity default

#: Reset the terminal

# map kitty_mod+delete clear_terminal reset active
# map opt+cmd+r        clear_terminal reset active

#::  You can create shortcuts to clear/reset the terminal. For
#::  example::

#::      # Reset the terminal
#::      map f1 clear_terminal reset active
#::      # Clear the terminal screen by erasing all contents
#::      map f1 clear_terminal clear active
#::      # Clear the terminal scrollback by erasing it
#::      map f1 clear_terminal scrollback active
#::      # Scroll the contents of the screen into the scrollback
#::      map f1 clear_terminal scroll active
#::      # Clear everything on screen up to the line with the cursor or the start of the current prompt (needs shell integration)
#::      map f1 clear_terminal to_cursor active
#::      # Same as above except cleared lines are moved into scrollback
#::      map f1 clear_terminal to_cursor_scroll active

#::  If you want to operate on all kitty windows instead of just the
#::  current one, use all instead of active.

#::  Some useful functions that can be defined in the shell rc files
#::  to perform various kinds of clearing of the current window:

#::  .. code-block:: sh

#::      clear-only-screen() {
#::          printf "\e[H\e[2J"
#::      }

#::      clear-screen-and-scrollback() {
#::          printf "\e[H\e[3J"
#::      }

#::      clear-screen-saving-contents-in-scrollback() {
#::          printf "\e[H\e[22J"
#::      }

#::  For instance, using these escape codes, it is possible to remap
#::  Ctrl+L to both scroll the current screen contents into the
#::  scrollback buffer and clear the screen, instead of just clearing
#::  the screen. For ZSH, in ~/.zshrc, add:

#::  .. code-block:: zsh

#::      ctrl_l() {
#::          builtin print -rn -- $'\r\e[0J\e[H\e[22J' >"$TTY"
#::          builtin zle .reset-prompt
#::          builtin zle -R
#::      }
#::      zle -N ctrl_l
#::      bindkey '^l' ctrl_l

#::  Alternatively, you can just add map ctrl+l clear_terminal
#::  to_cursor_scroll active to kitty.conf which works with no changes
#::  to the shell rc files, but only clears up to the prompt, it does
#::  not clear anytext at the prompt itself.

#: Clear up to cursor line

# map cmd+k clear_terminal to_cursor active

#: Reload kitty.conf

# map kitty_mod+f5 load_config_file
# map ctrl+cmd+,   load_config_file

#::  Reload kitty.conf, applying any changes since the last time it
#::  was loaded. Note that a handful of options cannot be dynamically
#::  changed and require a full restart of kitty. Particularly, when
#::  changing shortcuts for actions located on the macOS global menu
#::  bar, a full restart is needed. You can also map a keybinding to
#::  load a different config file, for example::

#::      map f5 load_config /path/to/alternative/kitty.conf

#::  Note that all options from the original kitty.conf are discarded,
#::  in other words the new configuration *replace* the old ones.

#: Debug kitty configuration

# map kitty_mod+f6 debug_config
# map opt+cmd+,    debug_config

#::  Show details about exactly what configuration kitty is running
#::  with and its host environment. Useful for debugging issues.

#: Send arbitrary text on key presses

#::  E.g. map ctrl+shift+alt+h send_text all Hello World

#::  You can tell kitty to send arbitrary (UTF-8) encoded text to the
#::  client program when pressing specified shortcut keys. For
#::  example::

#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text all Special text

#::  This will send "Special text" when you press the Ctrl+Alt+A key
#::  combination. The text to be sent decodes ANSI C escapes
#::  <https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/ANSI_002dC-
#::  Quoting.html> so you can use escapes like \e to send control
#::  codes or \u21fb to send Unicode characters (or you can just input
#::  the Unicode characters directly as UTF-8 text). You can use
#::  `kitten show-key` to get the key escape codes you want to
#::  emulate.

#::  The first argument to send_text is the keyboard modes in which to
#::  activate the shortcut. The possible values are normal,
#::  application, kitty or a comma separated combination of them. The
#::  modes normal and application refer to the DECCKM cursor key mode
#::  for terminals, and kitty refers to the kitty extended keyboard
#::  protocol. The special value all means all of them.

#::  Some more examples::

#::      # Output a word and move the cursor to the start of the line (like typing and pressing Home)
#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal Word\e[H
#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text application Word\eOH
#::      # Run a command at a shell prompt (like typing the command and pressing Enter)
#::      map ctrl+alt+a send_text normal,application some command with arguments\r
